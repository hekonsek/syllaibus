This project contains specification pieces of different types located in:
- `spex/**/*.md`
- `.spex/imports/**/*.md`

Depending of the specification type it will be located in a relevant subdirectory like `adr`, `instruction`, `dataformat`, `feature`, etc.

Please take these specifications under consideration when working with project.

When in doubt specifications in `spex` should take precedene over imported specifications in `.spex/imports`.
